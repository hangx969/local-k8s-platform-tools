# k8s-platform-tools

This project automates the deployment of a **production-grade Kubernetes application platform** by integrating key open-source tools for:

- **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** – Secure authentication and fine-grained authorization
- **Observability** – Comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and centralized log collection
- **Service Mesh & Networking** – Layer 7 proxy and ingress management
- **Workload Orchestration** – Resource quotas, scaling, and scheduling controls
- **Security & Secrets** – Certificate lifecycle management and secret storage
- **Asynchronous Processing** – Message queue for event-driven workflows

Built on Kubernetes, this platform provides **enterprise-ready infrastructure** with automated toolchain integration, reducing operational overhead while ensuring security and scalability.
